## A Discord bot created with the **[D++](https://dpp.dev/) Discord API Bot Library** for limited, personal use.

This Discord bot has been created with three main reasons in mind:
1) Ease-of-use; Certain functionality has been too niche for individual users to handle on our private server
2) Improving my C++ skills with an actual, practical project
3) Fun

As a result of it being made for private use, it's impossible to guarantee that any functionality contained within may suit any group of users apart from the ones that it's been specifically tailored to. However, it may serve as a good introduction to anyone aspiring to make a bot with this library, since every feature included has circumnavigated all potential compatibility issues and outdated wiki articles, at least as of mid-2024.

> [!NOTE]
> The dependencies and other files required to run everything correctly are [too large for GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files/about-git-large-file-storage), therefore they've intentionally been omitted from this particular repository. Contained within you'll find _MyBot.cpp_ which is the main modifiable [D++](https://dpp.dev/) file. Downloading (or in any other way accessing) the files of this repository isn't enough to run the bot by itself since said files are missing, however pasting these contents into a [standard Windows D++ template](https://github.com/brainboxdotcc/windows-bot-template) and then running the _MyBot.sln_ file (contained in the template, not here!) should see the bot working correctly on, at the very least, Windows.
