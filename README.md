## A Discord bot created with the **[D++](https://dpp.dev/) Discord API Bot Library** for limited, personal use.
https://github.com/brainboxdotcc/windows-bot-template

The dependencies and other files required to run everything correctly are [too large for GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files/about-git-large-file-storage), therefore they've intentionally been omitted from this particular repository. Contained within you'll find _MyBot.cpp_ which is the main modifiable [D++](https://dpp.dev/) file. Downloading (or in any other way accessing) the files of this repository isn't enough to run the bot by itself since said files are missing, however pasting these contents into a [standard Windows D++ template](https://dpp.dev/https://github.com/brainboxdotcc/windows-bot-template) and then running the _MyBot.sln_ file (contained in the template, not here!) should see the bot working correctly on, at the very least, Windows.
